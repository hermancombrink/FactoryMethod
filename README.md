#Pros
 You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.
 Single Responsibility Principle. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.
 Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.

 #Cons
 The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern. The best case scenario is when youâ€™re introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.
